### Overview
My app will help onboard new employees, residents, and medical students in their jobs and rotations through Saint Louis University Eye Institutes Ophthalmology rotation. The application will make the work enviroment more efficent. Users will have the work-up styles of eache doctor and also the instructions on how to run each piece of equiptment the doctor uses. This idea came from being in the work place in a enviornment with high turn over rate and a long period of time to understand the flow and operations of the work place. I noticed that it would take six months for new employees to get the full understanding of the job and sometimes even longer. I also noticed that it would benifit medical studetnes and residents because they would be able to learn the clinic's operations much faster.

### Features
The features that would be included would be a user login feature, with different tiers of user accesablity. Certain users will have the ablitity to add, delete, and edit users. The second feature will be the ability to add, delete, and edit doctors instructions and also test instructions. Another feature will be uploading images that tie directly to the doctors and test. The final feature I will add is a calender feature that may or may not show the work schedule of said doctors.   

### Technologies
I will be using Java, Spring Boot, MySql, Sass, Css/HTMl, Intellij, and possibly an Api of some sort.

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn how to attache an image to a Java object. I will hve to learn javascript to make my app responsive and interactive. I will have to improve my skills in CSS/HTML. I will have to figure out how to add a calender.
